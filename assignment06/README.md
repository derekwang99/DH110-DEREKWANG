# Interface Design

## About the Project

The project that I am designing involves creating a new mobile product that allows senior citizens to connect with each other based on similar interests and geographic location. The goal in doing so is to improve the mental health of the elder demographic by allowing them to experience feelings of companionship and belonging. The purpose of this high-fidelity prototyping phase is to create a working model that elder users can test out so that problematic features can be tweaked to fit their needs. Because this demographic faces greater accessibility issues, this phase is especially important. This phase will consist of UI planning, prototype development, impression testing, analysis of our findings.

## The Interactive Prototype's Supported Tasks

1. Discover new communities with ease via the interactive search process.
2. The ability to join and browse an existing community.
3. Message and interact with other senior citizens.

## UI Decision Making

## Design System

* **Typeface:** Quicksand
* **Size:** 24px (H1), 18px (H2), 16px (H3)
* **Color Scheme:**

**Thought Process:** I chose to make the fonts a bit larger than normal (18px), and made the colors very high contrast (black/white) due to the fact that senior citizens tend to poorer vision. The accessibility checks satisfied both *WCAG AA* and *WCAG AAA* standards. Additionally, incorporating a mainly black and white dark mode theme means that more colors can be used harmoniously and cause the least strain on the eyes as possible. Designing for accessibility helps everyone use a product better. I also chose to similarly model the project after Facebook, since Facebook is relatively common among this demographic. 


## Checking Accessibility
