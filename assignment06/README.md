# Interface Design

## About the Project

The project that I am designing involves creating a new mobile product that allows senior citizens to connect with each other based on similar interests and geographic location. The goal in doing so is to improve the mental health of the elder demographic by allowing them to experience feelings of companionship and belonging. The purpose of this high-fidelity prototyping phase is to create a working model that elder users can test out so that problematic features can be tweaked to fit their needs. Because this demographic faces greater accessibility issues, this phase is especially important. This phase will consist of UI planning, prototype development, impression testing, analysis of our findings.


## The Interactive Prototype's Supported Tasks

1. Discover new communities with ease via the interactive search process.
2. The ability to browse an existing community.
3. Message and interact with other senior citizens.

## UI Decision Making

## Design System

* **Typeface:** Quicksand
* **Size:** 24px (H1), 18px (H2), 16px (H3)
* **Color Scheme:**

* **Grid Layout:**

**Thought Process:** I chose to make the fonts a bit larger than normal (18px), and made the colors very high contrast (black/white) due to the fact that senior citizens tend to poorer vision. The accessibility checks satisfied the corresponding *WCAG AA* and *WCAG AAA* standards. Additionally, incorporating a mainly black and white dark mode theme means that more colors can be used harmoniously. Additionally, pure white (#FFFFFF) was not used. A slightly lighter shade (#F9F9F9) was used to cause the least strain on the eyes as possible. Designing for accessibility helps everyone use a product better. A lot of the navigation for pages involve using the "Back" and "Next" buttons rather than swiping since button pressing may be more intuitive than just swiping. I also chose to similarly model the project after Facebook, since Facebook is relatively common among this demographic. 


## Checking Accessibility

### Contrast Check for Newsfeed
Accessibility check satisfied for the newsfeed.

### Analysis of the test
The user seemed to get the gist of the app, saying that it was a sort of fuse between Facebook and Instagram. Upon asking him what the questions were for, he correctly responded that it was likely to narrow down one's interests to find a group. The user did not have much to say about the intial slide designs (the emotion level check-up and the recommendations. 

## Revisions
1. I changed my primary color from a grey (#595959) to a darker grey (#424242) to improve contrast even more, and for the whiter panels, I changed the text color from grey (#666666) to pitch black (#000000), which now satisfies WCAG AAA and better serves the elderly's vision. 
2. I added more screens to better support the prototype's goals and tasks.

## Reflection
Overall, I found this assignment rather fun because I really got to practice prototyping and ended up creating supplemental features to make the entire project more cohesive. I had to watch a lot of tutorials to get some things to work the way I wanted to, and should have used more of Figma's useful features like components and grouping. It would have saved me a lot of time and would have gave me more room for experimentation for fonts/colors/size. I think one area that I really need to improve on is transitions/animations. I would love to make my prototypes look more professional by making the transitions smoother and more complex, but that will require much independent study. I do plan to learn more about this topic over the summer and learn Adobe AfterEffects to integrate more motion into my prototypes.
