# Assignment 03

## Step01: Specify the Main Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
> This project is meant to support the mental health of the elderly by allowing them to connect with other elderly folk in their communities and to introduce them to trending activities and topics to allow them to reintegrate into society. With this project, I hope to allow the elderly to connect with new friends and to bridge the cultural gap between the elderly and the younger generations.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

> The basic need involved is the psychological need of belonginess & love. As the children of the elderly grow their own families, their role as guardian is further displaced which results in a growing sense of loneliness and sometimes even abandonment. This project aims to provide a community for lonely seniors that wish to make more friends.

#### What are traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs? 
> The traditional solution to satisfy the need for belongingness/love is, in a sense, Facebook. Facebook allows people of all ages to connect with each other and enjoy trending/viral content together. However, because the age demographic of Facebook is so varied, generational gaps and clashes are bound to occur (which is especially evident in the Comments section). I hope that my project will provide a safe community for the elderly to discuss and interact.

#### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with digital technology?

> Current limitations of networking for the elderly is that the elderly have fewer means of transportation which make in-person meetups more difficult—especially in the current state of the pandemic. Additionally, the elderly are more susceptible to being taken advantage of. As such, providing a safe space for the elderly to communicate online gives them much needed companionship.

## Step02: Target users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
	
 > Demographic: The target users would be people the age of 66 and above. This encompasses people who have just begun to retire or have been in retirement for a few years/decades.

> Preferences: Users that are willing to put themselves out there and engage with their community. 

> Expertise: This project would be catered towards users that have limited experience in using the internet/technology.

#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)

> There are two activities that can be accomplished as a result of the project. The first activity is meeting other senior citizens with similar interests and goals and befriending each other. The second activity is actually meeting in-person if the circumstance allows it. However, the focus of this project is to allow users to mainly communicate online for ease of convenience. 

#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

> The user would have to search for a particular community they are interested in (e.g. knitting, cooking) and parse through the profiles of other people (Tinder/Bumble style) with similar interests. From there, users can chat, share knowledge, and provide companionship. Users would have the option to call face-to-face.   Aside from networking, users would read blogs/articles written from other users and engage with trending topics.

## Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
> Methods: I will be employing participatory observation to conduct my research. I will be observing the participant as they navigate and interact with Reddit and Facebook to find trending content and  interesting communities to join.
> Where: This will be conducted in the home of the participant.
> The interview will be recorded via Zoom.

> The session consisted of the following sections:

1. Background questions a. I wanted to learn about what a typical day looks like for the target users, and how my website could support those daily tasks. I also asked about any enjoyable and frustrating experiences they had that were not necessarily related to searching Asian American history.

2. Observation a. I allowed the user to search up a topic that they wished to learn more about and asked that they think aloud. b. When users refined their search or chose certain results, I asked follow-up questions to clarify their thought process.

3. Follow-up questions a. These were directive. I sought to understand alternative sources of information that users tapped into, besides the one shown in the observation period.

## Insights


## Reflection

This assignment made me appreciate the value of good questions. Throughout the script development process, I found it quite difficult to find relevant questions because I found my scope of the project to be a bit too broad. I think I will try to narrow down my project in the subsequent weeks. I also found it difficult to word questions in a neutral way. For example, I was going to ask "Would you prefer there to be a moderator in the community? Or would you prefer the community to be more unstructured?". Unstructured has an inherent assoication to being poorly managed. As such, I had to brainstorm ways to ask this. I ultimately settled on "Would you prefer the presence of a moderator or leader in your community? Or would you prefer the presence of such a figure to be kept at a minimum?", which sounds a bit more neutral. This activity made me realize that sometimes it is more natural to veer off the script and allow the interviewee to really delve into whatever they’re saying. I found their answer to be much more genuine that way. However, I think it has to be balanced with how long you let them speak and how far you let them veer off course because I feel like the interview would have taken 2 hours had I not intervened at times. A particularly important insight that I gained is that the interviewer must give enough background information and specific enough activities to the interviewees because they are not as accustomed to using recent technology. The interviewee struggled to even begin the activity so I had to guide them at times. Ultimately, this activity made me appreciate the value of different perspectives across ages because the learning process, reactions, and content generation are all different.
