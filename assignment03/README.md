# Assignment 03

##Step 1: Specify the Main Design Challenge

### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
| This project is meant to support the mental health of the elderly by allowing them to connect with other elderly folk in their communities and to introduce them to trending activities and topics to allow them to reintegrate into society. With this project, I hope to allow the elderly to connect with new friends and to bridge the gap between the elderly and the younger generations.

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

### What are traditional/current solitoins(s) to satisfy the needs? 
	The traditional solution to satisfy the need for ___ is, in a sense, Facebook. Facebook allows people of all ages to connect with each other and enjoy trending/viral content together. However, because the age demographic of Facebook is so varied, generational gaps and clashes are bound to occur. I hope that my project will provide a “safer” community for the elderly to discuss and interact.

### What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with digital technology?

	Current limitations of networking for the elderly is that the elderly have fewer means of transportation which make in-person meetups more difficult—especially in the current state of the pandemic. Additionally, the elderly are more susceptible to being taken advantage of. As such, providing a safe space for the elderly to communicate online gives them much needed companionship. 

## Step02: Target users

###What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
	
Demographic: The target users would be people the age of 66 and above. This encompasses people who have just begun to retire or have been in retirement for a few years/decades.

Preferences: Users that are willing to put themselves out there and engage with their community. 

Expertise: This project would be catered towards users that have limited experience in using the internet/technology.

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
	
	There are two activities that can be accomplished as a result of the project. The first activity is meeting other senior citizens with similar interests and goals and befriending each other. The second activity is actually meeting in-person if the circumstance allows it. However, the focus of this project is to allow users to mainly communicate online for ease of convenience.  

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
  The user would have to search for a particular community they are interested in (e.g. knitting, cooking) and parse through the profiles of other people (Tinder/Bumble style) with similar interests. From there, users can chat, share knowledge, and provide companionship. Users would have the option to call face-to-face.   Aside from networking, users would read blogs/articles written from other users and engage with trending topics.


Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
* Interview with direct / passive / participatory observation. 
* Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO) 

Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 
* Decide where to visit 
* Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do 
* Decide how to interact with the users  
* Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images) 
* Prepare the interview guide (examples + template here -- this guide is designed for search activity but you need to edit with your contextual questions according to the activity, not search activity, you want to learn from the users) 

Step05: Conduct the research
* Visit the place 
* Meet/Observe the user(s) 
* Collect the data (record, pictures, answered_survey) 

Step06: Organize/Documentation
* In github (sub)repository assignment4, create one document (either README.md or .html) 
* Describe your project design challenge + target user (step1+2) 
* Describe your research methods and plan (step3) 
* Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4)  
* Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github 
* Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5) 
* Provide a link to the transcript of your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-aloud during observation, useful transcript tool here)  
* Write a reflection
