# Senior Circle

## Derek Wang

### Introduction

As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, people have had to adapt to the new status quo. However, an invisible, vulnerable population is often left out of the discourse: senior citizens. Senior citizens need an easy way to use technology to adapt to the isolating circumstances we face today. I believe that senior citizens would greatly benefit from an app that promotes socialization and counsels mental health. Building upon these two concepts and incorporating user-centered design for the elder demographic could mean greater accessibility and quality of life for them, especially during these trying times.

### Design Statement

THe purpose of this project is to create a product that connects local senior citizens with each other with the goal of improving mental health through companionship.
