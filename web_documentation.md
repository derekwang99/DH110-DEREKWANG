# Senior Circle

## Derek Wang

### Introduction

As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, people have had to adapt to the new status quo. However, an invisible, vulnerable population is often left out of the discourse: senior citizens. Senior citizens need an easy way to use technology to adapt to the isolating circumstances we face today. I believe that senior citizens would greatly benefit from an app that promotes socialization and counsels mental health. Building upon these two concepts and incorporating user-centered design for the elder demographic could mean greater accessibility and quality of life for them, especially during these trying times.

### Design Statement

THe purpose of this project is to create a product that connects local senior citizens with each other with the goal of improving mental health through companionship.

| Overall Evaluiation |   This app would be very difficult for senior citizens to navigate given that many things are ambiguous and cryptic. This app contains poor choice of iconography and contains uncommon jargon like "Print Waiting ..." that increase cognitive load. Users would be constantly frustrated by frequently opening the camera function on accident since the Upload Image button is large and in the middle of the screen. Users would also be frustrated by the inability to undo an action--one page actually requires the user to restart the app to get back to homepage. Moreover, there are unnecessary animations and startling sounds that would confuse and even scare tech-averse users. This app requires major improvement.      | Overall, this is a functional app that gets the job done. However, the lack of description and overreliance of iconography may leave users confused, especially for the elder demographic. This app could also benefit from better grouping of icons/content. A carousel is at the top of the screen, but only serves as clutter as it repeats information listed (as buttons) on the bottom. This carousel implies that the contents are buttons, but are in fact static images, which may frustrate the user. Additionally, some functions are placed on the wrong page, and some functions need not take up an entire slot. For example, Settings could easily be tucked away as a smaller icon and placed on the top righthand corner to reduce clutter.

The pilot usability test confirmed some of the weaknesses I have seen in Senior Assist Reminder and Learning, and taught me much about the usability test process. The pilot test taught me to be cognizant of what I say and what I do. Behaving a certain way, even subconsciously, can alter the user's results during the interview. Thus it is important to be careful every step of the way. Since the user can look at the app with fresh eyes and a new perspective, they were able to catch more issues that I overlooked. Overall, the interview went well! The user successfully completed most tasks and had a lot of feedback for the app. However, a few things could be improved. Firstly, I could have rehearsed the script better so that I would sound more natural. Secondly, towards the end, I was unsure whether to vocalize the instructions or not since they were rather self explanatory--the user was likely starting to grow impatient and began to complete the page before I even prompted them to do so. Thirdly, there was a typo that caught me off guard and caused me to break my train of thought. Hollistically, the usability test was a relative success. The participant did enunciate some of his thinking process and pointed out some issues. The participant had little issue interpreting my tasks, which I particularly appreciate. To improve my usability tests in the future, the next time I will rehearse more, keep a consistent way of conducting the experiment, and double check the survey for grammatical errors or typos for the sake of professionalism.
