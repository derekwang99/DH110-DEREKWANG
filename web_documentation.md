# Senior Circle

## Derek Wang

### Introduction

As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, people have had to adapt to the new status quo. However, an invisible, vulnerable population is often left out of the discourse: senior citizens. Senior citizens need an easy way to use technology to adapt to the isolating circumstances we face today. I believe that senior citizens would greatly benefit from an app that promotes socialization and counsels mental health. Building upon these two concepts and incorporating user-centered design for the elder demographic could mean greater accessibility and quality of life for them, especially during these trying times.

### Design Statement

The purpose of this project is to create a product that connects local senior citizens with each other with the goal of improving mental health through companionship. This project aims to not only make communication between senior citizens more accessible by providing a space dedicated to their age group, but also to create a friendly product that is as personal as possible to make users feel cared for. 

### Competitor Analysis

#### Heuristic Evaluation

While I could not find direct competitors of Senior Circle, I was able to find some apps that are catered for seniors and analyzed their interface and user experience.

| Overall Evaluiation |   This app would be very difficult for senior citizens to navigate given that many things are ambiguous and cryptic. This app contains poor choice of iconography and contains uncommon jargon like "Print Waiting ..." that increase cognitive load. Users would be constantly frustrated by frequently opening the camera function on accident since the Upload Image button is large and in the middle of the screen. Users would also be frustrated by the inability to undo an action--one page actually requires the user to restart the app to get back to homepage. Moreover, there are unnecessary animations and startling sounds that would confuse and even scare tech-averse users. This app requires major improvement.      | Overall, this is a functional app that gets the job done. However, the lack of description and overreliance of iconography may leave users confused, especially for the elder demographic. This app could also benefit from better grouping of icons/content. A carousel is at the top of the screen, but only serves as clutter as it repeats information listed (as buttons) on the bottom. This carousel implies that the contents are buttons, but are in fact static images, which may frustrate the user. Additionally, some functions are placed on the wrong page, and some functions need not take up an entire slot. For example, Settings could easily be tucked away as a smaller icon and placed on the top righthand corner to reduce clutter.

#### Usability Testing of Senior Assist and Anvayaa:

As a part of the competitve analysis, I conducted a pilot usability test to learn how users navigate around Senior Assist and Anvayaa. The interview can be found below.

<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7dqTuaKRRkg" width = "900px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

The pilot usability test confirmed some of the weaknesses I have seen in Senior Assist Reminder and Learning, and taught me much about the usability test process. The pilot test taught me to be cognizant of what I say and what I do. Behaving a certain way, even subconsciously, can alter the user's results during the interview. Thus it is important to be careful every step of the way. Since the user can look at the app with fresh eyes and a new perspective, they were able to catch more issues that I overlooked. Overall, the interview went well! The user successfully completed most tasks and had a lot of feedback for the app. However, a few things could be improved. Firstly, I could have rehearsed the script better so that I would sound more natural. Secondly, towards the end, I was unsure whether to vocalize the instructions or not since they were rather self explanatory--the user was likely starting to grow impatient and began to complete the page before I even prompted them to do so. Thirdly, there was a typo that caught me off guard and caused me to break my train of thought. Hollistically, the usability test was a relative success. The participant did enunciate some of his thinking process and pointed out some issues. The participant had little issue interpreting my tasks, which I particularly appreciate. To improve my usability tests in the future, the next time I will rehearse more, keep a consistent way of conducting the experiment, and double check the survey for grammatical errors or typos for the sake of professionalism.

The full pilot usability test and materials can be found [here](https://github.com/derekwang99/DH110-DEREKWANG/tree/main/assignment02).

### User Research

To further investigate how elder users interact with technology that is catered to them, I conducted contextual inquiry by observing how the participant navigates around Facebook, an open-ended social media app that fits all demographics.

##### Insights

After conducting the contextual inquiry, I found some insights to be interesting:

1. Members of the elder generation that aren't good with technology learn about trending topics through their children.
> "So my kids, they, they're more alert to trending topics. And some of my friends will send me YouTube too. So if I have time I will watch."

2. Here, the interviewee chose to watch a 25 minute-long documentary-esque video on cooking food in an Asian forest. The elder generation may appreciate higher quality content--throughout the session, the interviewee talked about how Facebook and Reddit had a lot of junk posts. The interviewee later searched for movies when prompted to look for viral content. I think that this generation doesn't really understand how the current generation dishes out tons of short, raw content (like few seconds to a minute on TikTok, etc) and are more used to movies and more established content. I think this video served as a happy intermediary between short, TikTok-like content and an actual movie.
> "What aspects of this content was interesting?"  

> "Well, um, the way they shoot the video, I feel it's not I don't want to say professional, but it's very attractive to, to view like, you know, the view the music and along with the, the interesting topics, plus the character. So you really want to continue to, to see what's going on and work through them prepare."
 
3. The elder generation may feel that online communities like Facebook Groups and Reddit may be too open-ended and as a result feel like their posts do not matter. The elder generation may not really care about metrics of likes or views as much as they do for comments. As such, I think an essential aspect to consider in developing any app/website for the elder generation is that we need to make them feel like they are important, perhaps through smaller communities will allow for greater connections to develop and encourage greater interactivity.
> Do you feel welcome in this community (Santa Clarita Foodies)?  

> Welcome? Well nobody cares (if I am around).


### UX Storytelling


1. Xinchen (Cindy) Zhang

The purpose of UX storytelling is to present a narrative that provides a natural and engaging way to describe the use of a product or the point of a user experience. UX storytelling helps us explain difficult concepts and the additional context allows our audience to connect better. Examples of this context include the user's emotions, reactions, motivations, needs, behaviors, and inner thoughts. This sort of qualitative context is difficult to discover from quantative data. A unique benefit of UX storytelling is that stories spark our imagination and give us the freedom to make up any scenario. As a result, multiple solutions can be thought by different people making up their own stories.

### Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototype

![wireframe wireflow](/assignment05/IMG_2895.png)

Flow description: This flow intends for the user to search for a community based on their own personal interests. Users are asked a few questions to determine what community should be recommended to them. Users will have the ability to go back and forth between selection pages. Users that wish to search for a community directly can still do so as the search bar remains in the same position throughout. After selecting on a community, users can join the community, make posts on the forum, view trending content, and message other members of the community. Within the message tab, users can select who they want to message and how they want to message them. For examples, users have the option of using voice-chat, hand-writing, sending an image, or just typing regularly. 


### High-Fidelity Prototype

The link to the prototype on Figma can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/6x37Y0Goi7V6a4eY8SFdH8/DH110-Project?node-id=0%3A1) and the presentation view can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/6x37Y0Goi7V6a4eY8SFdH8/DH110-Project?node-id=31%3A96&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1).


### Evaluation and Revision History

Revisions: 
1. I changed my primary color from a grey (#595959) to a darker grey (#424242) to improve contrast even more, and for the whiter panels, I changed the text color from grey (#666666) to pitch black (#000000), which now satisfies WCAG AAA and better serves the elderly's vision. 
2. I added more screens to better support the prototype's goals and tasks.
