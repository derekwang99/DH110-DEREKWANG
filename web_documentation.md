# Senior Circle by Derek Wang

## Introduction

As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, people have had to adapt to the new status quo. However, an invisible, vulnerable population is often left out of the discourse: senior citizens. Senior citizens need an easy way to use technology to adapt to the isolating circumstances we face today. I believe that senior citizens would greatly benefit from an app that promotes socialization and counsels mental health. Building upon these two concepts and incorporating user-centered design for the elder demographic could mean greater accessibility and quality of life for them, especially during these trying times.

## Design Statement

The purpose of this project is to create a product that connects local senior citizens with each other with the goal of improving mental health through companionship. This project aims to not only make communication between senior citizens more accessible by providing a space dedicated to their age group, but also to create a friendly product that is as personal as possible to make users feel cared for.

## Competitor Analysis

### Heuristic Evaluation

While I could not find direct competitors of Senior Circle, I was able to find some apps that are catered for seniors and analyzed their interface and user experience. 

|      | Application 1| Application 2 |
|--------|------------| ------- |
| Name      | Senior Assist | Anvayaa | 
| URL      | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/senior-assist-reminder-learning/id1079081521 | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anvayaa/id1123534017

| Overall Evaluiation |   This app would be very difficult for senior citizens to navigate given that many things are ambiguous and cryptic. This app contains poor choice of iconography and contains uncommon jargon like "Print Waiting ..." that increase cognitive load. Users would be constantly frustrated by frequently opening the camera function on accident since the Upload Image button is large and in the middle of the screen. Users would also be frustrated by the inability to undo an action--one page actually requires the user to restart the app to get back to homepage. Moreover, there are unnecessary animations and startling sounds that would confuse and even scare tech-averse users. This app requires major improvement.      | Overall, this is a functional app that gets the job done. However, the lack of description and overreliance of iconography may leave users confused, especially for the elder demographic. This app could also benefit from better grouping of icons/content. A carousel is at the top of the screen, but only serves as clutter as it repeats information listed (as buttons) on the bottom. This carousel implies that the contents are buttons, but are in fact static images, which may frustrate the user. Additionally, some functions are placed on the wrong page, and some functions need not take up an entire slot. For example, Settings could easily be tucked away as a smaller icon and placed on the top righthand corner to reduce clutter.

### Usability Testing of Senior Assist and Anvayaa:

As a part of the competitve analysis, I conducted a pilot usability test to learn how users navigate around Senior Assist and Anvayaa. The interview can be found below.

The pilot usability test confirmed some of the weaknesses I have seen in Senior Assist Reminder and Learning. The participant ultimately did complete all of the assigned tasks, but did have some difficulty navigating some pages.

## User Research

To further investigate how elder users interact with technology that is catered to them, I conducted contextual inquiry by observing how the participant navigates around Facebook, an open-ended social media app that fits all demographics.

### Insights

After conducting the contextual inquiry, I found some insights to be interesting:

##### Members of the elder generation that aren't good with technology learn about trending topics through their children.
> "So my kids, they, they're more alert to trending topics. And some of my friends will send me YouTube too. So if I have time I will watch."

##### The elder generation may appreciate higher quality content.

> "What aspects of this content was interesting?"  

> "Well, um, the way they shoot the video, I feel it's not I don't want to say professional, but it's very attractive to, to view like, you know, the view the music and along with the, the interesting topics, plus the character. So you really want to continue to, to see what's going on and work through them prepare."

The interviewee chose to watch a 25 minute-long documentary-esque video on cooking food in an Asian forest. Later, she talked about how Facebook and Reddit had a lot of junk posts. The interviewee later searched for movies when prompted to look for viral content. I think that this generation doesn't really understand how the current generation dishes out tons of short, raw content (like few seconds to a minute on TikTok, etc) and are more used to movies and more established content. I think this video served as a happy intermediary between short, TikTok-like content and an actual movie.
 
##### The elder generation may feel that online communities like Facebook Groups and Reddit may be too open-ended and as a result feel like their posts do not matter. 

> Do you feel welcome in this community (Santa Clarita Foodies)?  

> Welcome? Well nobody cares (if I am around).

The elder generation may not really care about metrics of likes or views as much as they do for comments. As such, I think an essential aspect to consider in developing any app/website for the elder generation is that we need to make them feel like they are important, perhaps through smaller communities will allow for greater connections to develop and encourage greater interactivity.

## UX Storytelling

To further understand our users, I performed UX storytelling through user personas, empathy maps, and journey maps to present a narrative that provides a natural/engaging way to describe user behavior. I tried to best encapsulate this by describing the user's emotions, reactions, motivations, needs, behaviors, and inner thoughts.

## Wireframe/Low-Fidelity Prototype

The purpose of this wireframe is to test out our assumptions and translate them into the basic framework of our product to see if the functionalities makes sense to older users. We can then adjust the prototype according the user feedback.

Based on user research, the most important features of the low-fidelity prototype will be able to do the following:

* Create an interactive (question-based) filtering search process to make finding a community simpler.
* The ability to join an existing community
* Contact another person and/or create a groupchat

## Low-Fidelity Prototype

<img src="https://github.com/derekwang99/DH110-DEREKWANG/raw/main/assignment05/IMG_2895.png" width="900" />

**Flow description:** This flow intends for the user to search for a community based on their own personal interests. Users are asked a few questions to determine what community should be recommended to them. Users will have the ability to go back and forth between selection pages. Users that wish to search for a community directly can still do so as the search bar remains in the same position throughout. After selecting on a community, users can join the community, make posts on the forum, view trending content, and message other members of the community. Within the message tab, users can select who they want to message and how they want to message them. For examples, users have the option of using voice-chat, hand-writing, sending an image, or just typing regularly.

## High-Fidelity Prototype

It is necessary to consider that this demographic is usually not tech savvy and may have physical impairments or disabilities that make using technology difficult (e.g. myopia/hyperopia, arthritis, limited mobility). Additionally, this demographic maybe also address technology with skepticism or may even fear using technology. As such, it is necessary to design a system/interface that is as simple, easy to read, and enjoyable.

### UI Decision Making for the Senior Citizen Demographic

I chose to make the fonts a bit larger than normal (18px), and made the colors very high contrast (black/white) due to the fact that senior citizens tend to poorer vision. Additionally, the accessibility checks are satisfied according to WCAG AA and WCAG AAA standards. I incorporated a mainly black and white dark mode theme so that more colors can be used harmoniously, and avoided pure white (#FFFFFF) backgrounds to avoid eye strain. A slightly lighter shade (#F9F9F9) was used instead. As for the interaction design, a lot of the navigation for pages involve using the "Back" and "Next" buttons rather than swiping since button pressing may be more intuitive to the elder demographic.

#### Graphic Design Element Variations

I created different yellow/lilac variants to see which theme best fit Senior Circle. In the end, I still went with the dark-mode theme because dark-mode is very gender-neutral, and is much easier on the eyes for our users. Dark-mode maintains very high contrast for easy readability, and does not cause eye pain when on maximum brightness (unlike the white-background of light mode). Perhaps in the future, users can chose their favorite color to set the app's color theme. Customizability makes a product more enjoyable to use.

## Conclusion & Reflection

This project took quite a lot of independent research, especially when it came to the actual prototyping process. Despite this, I found the whole process to be quite interesting and very meaningful. I found it very satisfying to see that each decision I made when it came to functionality or interface design was indeed motivated by a real concern for the user. It is through this project that I realize that designing for accessibility helps everyone use a product better--everyone benefits from improved readability and guided product usage. Considering that this is my first exposure to the full iterative design process, I am satisfied with my final prototype. I do wish I spent more time thinking about additional capabilities and "routes" of the interactive search process, but for the purposes of the project, it is enough. Moving fowrard, I wish to learn more about interaction design and even designing for AI.
