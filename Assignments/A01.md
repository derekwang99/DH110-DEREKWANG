## Derek Wang - Digital Humanities 110

As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, people have had to adapt to the new status quo. However, an invisible, vulnerable population is often left out of the discourse: senior citizens. Senior citizens need an accessible way to reintegrate themselves into society. I believe that senior citizens would greatly benefit from an app that would help with daily activities, promote socialization, and counsel mental health. I found two apps that I believe could help the elderly, but suffer from a lot of shortcomings that would prove difficult for tech-averse users: Senior Assist and Anvayaa on the iOS App Store. Improving these apps could mean greater quality of life for our senior citizens, especially during these trying times. 

## Severity Scale for Usability Problems
This 1-3 scale can be used to rate the severity of usability problems within the apps. 

| Rating | Importance |
|--------|:----------:|
| 1      | Little to no issues, issues that arise are cosmetic |
| 2      | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3      | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
