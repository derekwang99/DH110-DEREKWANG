# Senior Citizen Assistance Apps to Improve Quality of Life 
## Derek Wang - Digital Humanities 110

As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, people have had to adapt to the new status quo. However, an invisible, vulnerable population is often left out of the discourse: senior citizens. Senior citizens need an accessible way to reintegrate themselves into society. I believe that senior citizens would greatly benefit from an app that would help with daily activities, promote socialization, and counsel mental health. I found two apps that I believe could help the elderly, but suffer from a lot of shortcomings that would prove difficult for tech-averse users: **Senior Assist Reminder & Learning** and **Anvayaa** on the iOS App Store. Improving these apps by making the design user-centered for the elder demographic could mean greater accessibility and quality of life for them, especially during these trying times. 

## Severity Scale for Usability Problems
This 1-3 scale can be used to rate the severity of usability problems within the apps. 

| Rating | Importance |
|--------|------------|
| 1      | Little to no issues, issues that arise are cosmetic |
| 2      | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3      | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

Information about the competitor web/app 

Provide the screenshot(s) of the web/app
Provide the URL (clickable to launch the website)
Provide brief information about the website
Provide your overall evaluation of that website
Heuristic evaluation (either by web_contents or by a downloadable document)

Provide all 10 heuristics listed
You need to review the websites with all 10 heuristics one by one, explain the heuristic in your own terms.
Provide the detailed analysis of the web/app with the comments 
The website may have no issue on that related heuristic you inspect - then, explain why you think the website is okay for your evaluation.
If the website violates the related heuristic, you will explain why and suggest the source of that issue and possible solution.




## App #1: Senior Assist Reminder & Learning

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/senior-assist-reminder-learning/id1079081521

`About:` Senior Assist is an app that prints simple instructions on the spot to serve as reminders for daily tasks or alternate forms of communication. The instructions are printed as large, readable lables so that they can be adhered onto surfaces or to be used as cue cards for those who speak a foreign language or are unable to speak.  
 
`Overall Evaluation:` This app would be very difficult for senior citizens to use given that many things are ambiguous and cryptic.  

app could benefit from a call-to-action that signifies the first step 

| Heuristic & Description | Evaluation | Suggested Solution
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **#1: Visibility of system status:** The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.      | (2): The page is very static. The user struggles where to start and struggles to understand where to first start typing.  <br /> (2):  There is no loading screen or initial tutorial to indicate the beginning. Upon opening the app, it jumps straight into the app's function without preface.       |  A cursor (blinking line to indicate where text appears) should be implemented in the "Title" field. Additionally, a quick loading screen (1 second) could help the user understand that the system has just start up and is ready to be used.  |
| 2      | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3      | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
