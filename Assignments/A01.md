# Senior Citizen Assistance Apps to Improve Quality of Life 
## Derek Wang - Digital Humanities 110

As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, people have had to adapt to the new status quo. However, an invisible, vulnerable population is often left out of the discourse: senior citizens. Senior citizens need an easy way to use technology to adapt to the isolating circumstances we face today. I believe that senior citizens would greatly benefit from an app that would help with daily activities, promote socialization, and counsel mental health. I found two similar apps on the iOS App Store that I believe could help the elderly: **Senior Assist Reminder & Learning** and **Anvayaa**. However, they suffer from a lot of shortcomings that would prove difficult for tech-averse users. Improving these apps by making the design user-centered for the elder demographic could mean greater accessibility and quality of life for them, especially during these trying times. 

## Severity Scale for Usability Problems
This is the 1-3 scale that we will use to rate the severity of usability problems within the apps. 

| Rating | Importance |
|--------|------------|
| 1      | Little to no issues, issues that arise are cosmetic |
| 2      | Is a minor usability problem--fixing this should be given low-medium priority |
| 3      | Major usability problem--fixing this should be given top priority |

## App #1:
### Senior Assist Reminder & Learning
Appstore Link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/senior-assist-reminder-learning/id1079081521 

`About:` Senior Assist is an app that prints simple instructions on the spot to serve as reminders for daily tasks or alternate forms of communication. The instructions are printed as large, readable lables so that they can be adhered onto surfaces or to be used as cue cards for those who speak a foreign language or are unable to speak. This app comes with pre-made templates to work with (e.g. To-do lists, Get X Medication).

</p>

**Overall Evaluation:** This app would be very difficult for senior citizens to navigate given that many things are ambiguous and cryptic. This app contains poor choice of iconography and contains uncommon jargon like "Print Waiting ..." that increase cognitive load. Users would be constantly frustrated by frequently opening the camera function on accident since the Upload Image button is large and in the middle of the screen. Users would also be frustrated by the inability to undo an action--one page actually requires the user to restart the app to get back to homepage. Moreover, there are unnecessary animations and startling sounds that would confuse and even scare tech-averse users. This app requires major improvement.


### Heuristic Evaluation

| Heuristic & Description | Evaluation | Suggested Solution|
|:----|:---------|:------|
| **#1: Visibility of system status:** Users should always understand the status of where they are at & what they are doing by receiving feedback from the system. | **(2)** The page is very static. The user struggles where to start and struggles to understand where to first start typing. **(2)**:  There is no loading screen or initial tutorial to indicate the beginning. Upon opening the app, it jumps straight into the app's function without preface.       |  A cursor (blinking line to indicate where text appears) should be implemented in the "Title" field. Additionally, a quick loading screen (1 second) could help the user understand that the system has just start up and is ready to be used.  |
| **#2: Match between system and the real world:** The design should follow colloquial language that are familiar to all. The design should avoid using unique jargon and provide information in a logical order. | **(2)** The "Print Waiting ..." is not a natural phrase people see often, so it can be confusing to some. The user would have to experiment and press it to understand what it actually does.  | Instead of "Print Waiting ...", the Print button should simply be labeled as "Print". |
| **#3: User control and freedom:** Users should be able to easily undo an action if they make a mistake, as this instills confidence in the user.  | **(3)** This app does not have a single back button. This problem is especially bad when users hit the settings icon. There is no option to escape and the navigation bar changes to a new set of icons, which ultimately ruins consistency. **(3)** This app does not have the swipe feature to swipe between pages like most other apps. <img src="/Images/Senior%20Assist%20Setting.jpg" width="250" />  | Every page should have an "x" button or a back button so that users can change their minds. This is especially evident in the setting page because the only way to get back to the homepage is to complete exit the app. Additionally, the swipe feature should be implemented so that users can quickly switch pages. |
| **#4: Consistency and standards:** Users should follow industry convention. Users should be able understand the meaning of iconography quickly and not have to guess.| **(3)** A lot of the icons are cryptic and some are even miused. The first 2 icons on the navigation bar are nearly uninterpretable, and the last icon is colloquially recognized as a Profile icon, but instead serves to show a tutorial. <img src="/Images/Senior%20Assist%20Navigation%20Bar.jpg" width="250" />| The icons should be properly selected and should fit the common standard. A profile icon should lead to the profile section. |
| **#5: Error prevention:** Present users with a way to check if they actually want to go through with the action to prevent accidental errors. Prevent errors from occurring in the first place. | **(3)** The Picture/Profile Picture can be easily changed by tapping the icon (a rather large icon too). Users will often accidentally hit this icon which opens up the camera app. | The ability to change the Picture/Profile Picture should be indicated by a small X on the upper left corner of the icon. The X is a clear indication to get rid/change the profile picture. This way users will not accidentally hit it andopen the camera. |
| **#6: Recognition rather than recall:** Users should not have to frequently memorize the interface. Additionally, important navigational items should be always visible and easily accessible. | **(3)** The navigation bar changes frequently depending on which page the user is at. Getting onto a new page means learning the new navigation, which is very taxing on the user. Users have to actively learn how to use the app. | The navigation bar should be unchanging to reinforce recognition. Additionally, they should be labeled because they are necessary to efficient navigation in that users will not have to guess the meaning of the icon. |
| **#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Allow users to access shortcuts to speed up frequent interactions. These shortcuts should be optional but always available for expert users. | **(2)** Additional options for export are tucked away in the 2nd icon in the navigation bar. Users that want to email or delete the label must first click on the tab and then actually perform the action. | Perhaps instead of a giant "Print" button, There can be four smaller buttons that can print, delete, save to Photos, and email. The 2nd icon in the navigation bar can be removed to reduce clutter. Alternatively, a better option would be to replace the "Print" with a general Export button, where users can then choose the subsequent action (print, delete, etc). |
|**#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design** Interfaces should not contain irrelevant information. Extra info has to compete with other info and reduces relative visibility. | **(1)** The layout is indeed minimal. However, some buttons in the navigation bar could be removed altogether. The "restart" and "export" button are taking up a lot of space. | The "restart" button should be a small X in the top left corner on the actual interface that users interact with for the functionality aspect. The export button can be moved to the actual interface as well, so that all functions are present and within proximity. |
| **#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors** Error messages should be easy to understand and indicate the issue clearly. The error should also offer a solution. | **(1)** Feedback is provided when nothing is input. Users are instructed to fill in minimum information before printing the label. | No changes need to be made, other than cosmetic ones. There should be more white space between the heading and subheading. |
| **#10: Help and documentation:** Users need to be able to access help in the event that they do not understand how to complete a task or need further explanation. | **(2)** The only sort of help/documentation on this app is on the "profile" icon, which gives a brief, 5-step tutorial on how to use the app. The problem is that users would not know that this tutorial exists unless they experiment and try out every button until they hit the "profile" icon--the last icon on the navigation bar <br /> <img src="/Images/Senior%20Assist%20Tutorial.jpg" width="250" /> <br /> **(3)** The different pages of the app are not labeled and fail to provide instructions. The user must click around to understand where they are/what the purpose of the page is. | The tutorial should be one of the first things the user should be greeted with upon opening the app for the very first time. Additionally, each page of the app should have some sort of text to preface what is going on. Headings and information/instructions should be added to ever page.  |



## App #2:
### Anvayaa
Appstore Link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anvayaa/id1123534017

`About:` This app is for a care facility that allows adults to stay connected with their senior citizen parents and keep track of daily tasks, appointments, medications, perform requests and deal with emergency situations on their behalf. This app promotes social engagement by organizing family events, arranging picnics, outings and other events. The app was built to provide reassurance that their parents are in the right hands by providing a channel to see what their parents are up to and how they are doing.

<p align = "middle"> 
            Left: Anvayaa Homepage, Right: Anvayaa Profile Page
</p>


`Overall Evaluation:` Overall, this is a functional app that gets the job done. However, the lack of description and overreliance of iconography may leave users confused, especially for the elder demographic. This app could also benefit from better grouping of icons/content. A carousel is at the top of the screen, but only serves as clutter as it repeats information listed (as buttons) on the bottom. This carousel implies that the contents are buttons, but are in fact static images, which may frustrate the user. Additionally, some functions are placed on the wrong page, and some functions need not take up an entire slot. For example, Settings could easily be tucked away as a smaller icon and placed on the top righthand corner to reduce clutter.

### Heuristic Evaluation

| Heuristic & Description | Evaluation | Suggested Solution|
|:----|:---------|:------|
| **#1: Visibility of system status:** Users should always understand the status of where they are at & what they are doing by receiving feedback from the system. | **(1)** The app does indeed indicate that the app has started up by briefly showing the launch page/logo for a split second. The app as a whole is rather static, though. **(1)** The app has a loading animation whenever pressing a button--this tells the users to be patient as the system is in the process of running. | This app has a carousel that shows representative pictures of their services. I think this could easily be made into a carousel that automatically swipes to the next image after around 2-3 seconds. This would show that the app is still live. |
| **#2: Match between system and the real world:** The design should follow colloquial language that are familiar to all. The design should avoid using unique jargon and provide information in a logical order.  | **(3)** One button is labeled "PMS", which the user might have to guess what it means. Based on a different page and the wallet icon, the user can infer that it means "Payment Management System". Additionally, one item is labeled "Escalations" in the settings panel. This is rather cryptic--if they meant that this tab documents something that happens to the patient, then this does not belong in Settings. </br> <img src="/Images/Anvayaa_PMS.jpg" width="150" /> <img src="/Images/Anvayaa_Escalations.jpg" width="150" /> <br /> **(2)** There is an overall lack of description as this app relies too heavily on iconography. Information is not provided in a logical order.  | "PMS" should be spelled out so that the user does not have to guess what it is. Additionally, the "Escalations" section should be moved into another page that describes patient well-being. The app should add description and headings throughout the app to better clarify their purposes and functions.|
| **#3: User control and freedom:** Users should be able to easily undo an action if they make a mistake, as this instills confidence in the user.   | **(1)** The top left of the subpages contain a distinct back button which is characterized as a back arrow. This is clear to the user that it means go back. The user can easily go back to the home page as the navigation bar is unchanging. | There is little to improve, as the pages have a back button and the user is prompted to Cancel whenever they perform an unwanted action. |
| **#4: Consistency and standards:** Users should follow industry convention. Users should be able understand the meaning of iconography quickly and not have to guess. | **(1)** For the most part, the iconography fits the task. However, "Care Manager Visits' and "Free Care Manager Visits" share the same icons. While the user can still infer what these buttons do based on the text label, it is bad practice to have an icon represent two things.  **(1)** Most apps these days have a swipe left/right funtion to go forward or back. Some users may find themselves swiping left and right to navigate but realizing that this doesn't exist, so it may frustrate the user. | "Free Care Manager Vist" should have a unique icon instead of sharing it with "Care Manager Vists". Additionally, this feature does not really need a whole button for it. It could easily be under Care Manager Visits. Given the amount of buttons already shown, reducing unnecessary buttons is beneficial. On another note, the app should implement a swiping-to-navigate feature to keep up with industry standards. |
| **#5: Error prevention:** Present users with a way to check if they actually want to go through with the action to prevent accidental errors. Prevent errors from occurring in the first place.  | **(2)** Unwanted actions can be prevented if functions and sections should be described so that users do not need to think about what exactly is going on. For example, in the Profile page, we have a lot of potential actions the user can make, but with no description or heading to preface what is inside each button. **(3)** The Emergency button does not have any heading or description to say what exactly happens when the user presses it. The user may press it out of curiosity to see what it does. Experimentation, especially with buttons that contain greater consequences, should be avoided. | This app could benefit from more details to describe certain app functions instead of just short two to three word labels. As for the Emergency button, there should be information to describe what happens when pressed. |
|  **#6: Recognition rather than recall:** Users should not have to frequently memorize the interface. Additionally, important navigational items should be always visible and easily accessible.  | **(2)** The layout and navigation bar are pretty consistent. However, the content is organized in a gridlike manner with little visual hierarchy. Additionally, like items are not found in the same row in the grid. As such, users would need to scan the page to see what they are looking for. | Like items should be grouped together and have a heading attached to them so that there is hierarchy. For example, in the Profile page, there should be a heading called "My Plans" and have My Care Plan, Payment Management System, Regular Health Plan grouped together. The Reminders should not be in Profile, and Beneficiary Details and Electronic Medical should be grouped together. Grouping would minimize cognitive load.  |
|  **#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Allow users to access shortcuts to speed up frequent interactions. These shortcuts should be optional but always available for expert users. | **(3)** There are no shortcuts of any sorts on this app.  | The app could implement a search bar so that the user can search for important functions or retrieve old messages/requests. Additionally, for faster navigation, swipe-to-navigate to go back and forth between pages would be helpful as the app still functions without this but would benefit users that are already familiar with this feature. |
|**#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design** Interfaces should not contain irrelevant information. Extra info has to compete with other info and reduces relative visibility.| **(2)** The middle/top half of the app should contain the most relevant information & features. However, it is wasted on a carousel that repeats the exact same information below but as buttons. The carousel is deceiving because they look like buttons but are not. | Carousels of pictures should have an indicator that shows the progression of images to allow the user to understand the status (progression) of the carousel. However, the carousel should be removed and instead be filled with relevant updates/reports on their parents, for example. |
|  **#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors** Error messages should be easy to understand and indicate the issue clearly. The error should also offer a solution.| **(1)** Users that do not have a paid plan yet cannot access some content. The system does indeed tell them to get a plan as a solution. | The system gives appropriate feedback--no changes need to be made. |
| **#10: Help and documentation:** Users need to be able to access help in the event that they do not understand how to complete a task or need further explanation. | **(1)** There is a "Call Anvayaa" tab for easy access to information containing Anvayaa's addresses, phone numbers, and email. **(2)** There is no help section or FAQ section, or a way to redirect to the Anvayaa website for more information/clarification. | Given the massive amount of extra space on this tab, the app can afford to enlarge the text, as some senior citizens have poorer vision. Additionally, this app should add a help section to troubleshoot common issues or at least a  website link for users to click to redirect them to their website for more information. |
