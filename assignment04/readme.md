## Purpose of UX Storytelling

The purpose of UX storytelling is to present a narrative that provides a natural and engaging way to describe the use of a product or the point of a user experience. UX storytelling helps us explain difficult concepts and the additional context allows our audience to connect better. Examples of this context include the user's emotions, reactions, motivations, needs, behaviors, and inner thoughts. This sort of qualitative context is difficult to discover from quantative data. A unique benefit of UX storytelling is that stories spark our imagination and give us the freedom to make up any scenario. As a result, multiple solutions can be thought by different people making up their own stories. 

## Design Features

1. An interactive filtering search process--when elder users wish to discover an new online community they may not know what to search up or where to start. The search process can turn into a sort of quiz that presents one question and few options at a time to prevent overwhelming the user. For example, the user would be asked "Do you like sports?", and if they respond "Yes", they would be presented with 4-6 options for available sports communities. If the options do not satisfy the user, a next set of options will appear and will continue to repeat until the options are exhausted. The option to directly search up an online community remains for more experienced users that wish to forgo the quizzing process.
2. Allow users to make their own online communities--there exists tons of niche communities that are specific to certain cultures. Users should have the freedom and flexiblity to create their own unique communities. These communities would be searchable and by default will only reveal local communities within a certain radius of the user as the point is to get users to meet in real life.

## Scenarios and Journey Maps

### Cindy's Scenario
> Cindy's mental health is deteriorating and often feels invisible in her own home. Her daughter and son-in-law mean well, but they themselves get up early and come home late for work. Cindy thus feels very lonely and isolated. After immigrating to the U.S., Cindy had to create a whole new social network. However, the greatest impediment to this is that Cindy could not speak English. Over the course of 10 years, she has learned enough English to get basic skills down (e.g. buying groceries, small talk, read some signs), but it is not enough to make lasting friendships due to the language barrier. Cindy hopes to find new friends that speak Chinese to just chat and likes to watch Chinese Dramas.
