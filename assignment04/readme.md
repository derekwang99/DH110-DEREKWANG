## Purpose of UX Storytelling

The purpose of UX storytelling is to present a narrative that provides a natural and engaging way to describe the use of a product or the point of a user experience. UX storytelling helps us explain difficult concepts and the additional context allows our audience to connect better. Examples of this context include the user's emotions, reactions, motivations, needs, behaviors, and inner thoughts. This sort of qualitative context is difficult to discover from quantative data. A unique benefit of UX storytelling is that stories spark our imagination and give us the freedom to make up any scenario. As a result, multiple solutions can be thought by different people making up their own stories. 

## Design Features

1. An interactive filtering search process--when elder users wish to discover an new online community they may not know what to search up or where to start. The search process can turn into a sort of quiz that presents one question and few options at a time to prevent overwhelming the user. For example, the user would be asked "Do you like sports?", and if they respond "Yes", they would be presented with 4-6 options for available sports communities. If the options do not satisfy the user, a next set of options will appear and will continue to repeat until the options are exhausted. The elderly find typing difficult so simply tapping options may be easier for them even if it takes longer. The option to directly search up an online community remains for more experienced users that wish to forgo the quizzing process.
2. Allow users to make their own online communities--there exists tons of niche communities that are specific to certain cultures. Users should have the freedom and flexiblity to create their own unique communities. These communities would be searchable and by default will only reveal local communities within a certain radius of the user as the point is to get users to meet in real life.

## Scenarios and Journey Maps

### Cindy's Scenario

**Why Cindy is using this product?**

> Cindy's mental health is deteriorating and often feels invisible in her own home. Her daughter and son-in-law mean well, but they themselves get up early and come home late for work. Cindy thus feels very lonely and isolated. After immigrating to the U.S., Cindy had to create a whole new social network. However, the greatest impediment to this is that Cindy could not speak English. Over the course of 10 years, she has learned enough English to get basic skills down (e.g. buying groceries, small talk, read some signs), but it is not enough to make lasting friendships due to the language barrier. Cindy hopes to find new friends that speak Chinese to just chat and likes to watch Chinese Dramas.  

**How Cindy is using this product?**

> Cindy opens up the app on her phone and creates an account. She is prompted to fill out basic information about herself and is asked to provide her location so that she can be recommended nearby people/communities. Cindy looks for a community and finds the C-Drama community. She sees what other folks in Alhambra are watching based on their posts in the community. Cindy wishes to make her own C-Drama watching group and makes a post saying "有沒有人想和我一起看 三国机密? (Would anybody like to watch 'Secret of Three Kingdoms' with me?)". A few days later, a person named Michelle responds and says yes! They schedule a time to meet and Michelle comes over to Cindy's on Monday. They watch the drama and discuss about it. They decide to meet regularly. Cindy uses this product to communicate with Michelle but found it easier to use WeChat instead. Now, Cindy uses this product mainly to find new friends and check what's up on her local neighborhood & community.

### William's Scenario

**Why William is using this product**

> William found himself to be very bored when his golfing buddy and closest friend of thirty years decides to move away to New Jersey to be closer with his family. William isn't fond of large groups of friends and instead opts to have one very close friend. He wants this potential friend to be as opinionated as he is and like to debate and discuss about the state of the world. It would be a big plus if they play golf, but he is willing to teach them. William doesn't like using his phone for things like this, but his more marginally tech-savy wife recommends it to just try it out. She is willing to help him navigate through the app if needed. William wants to delete this app after finding a friend. 

**How William is using this product** 
> William logs onto his new account and fills out his basic information. When asked what sort of community he would like to join, he goes through the interactive search process and ends up on the Golf community. Here, he discovers that Palo Alto already has a golfing club and decides to join that. He meets up with the club sporadically. William is suggested the Palo Alto community and curiously taps on that community. He sees that other seniors are posting what they are cooking, what they are doing, what they've seen on the news, what new pet they have adopted, what new restaurants are good, what sort of crimes have been happening around the neigborhood, and more. William checks up on this community frequently. William is still on his search for a close friend/golfing partner and direct messages different golfers and ultimately befriends Aaron. Aaron comes over every Sunday to William's house for brunch with his wife. Ultimately, William decides to keep this app on his phone to stay connected with his community.
