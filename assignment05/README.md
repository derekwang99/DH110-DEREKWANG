# Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype

## Project Description

The premise of the project is to produce a product that is able to connect nearby senior citizens with each other to form communities of similar interests to improve their mental health through companionship. The user personas that were constructed were based on elderly people that are likely retired. This demographic is usually not tech savvy and have physical impairments or disabilities that make using technology difficult (e.g. myopia/hyperopia, arthritis, limited mobility). This demographic also tend to be lonelier and need greater emotional support as they often deal with a lot of problems (e.g. significant other/friends pass away, family is far away, health concerns, etc). This demographic maybe also address technology with skepticism or may even fear using technology. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test out our concepts and translate them into the basic framework of our product to see if the functionalities makes sense to older users. We can then adjust the prototype according the user feedback.

## Supported Task & Features

Based on user research, the features of the low-fidelity prototype will be able to do the following:
* Create an interactive (question-based) filtering search process to make finding a community simpler.
* The ability to join an existing community
* Contact another person and/or create a groupchat 

## Wireframes and Wireflow

Flow description: This flow intends for the user to search for a community based on their own personal interests. Users are asked a few questions to determine what community should be recommended to them. Users will have the ability to go back and forth between selection pages. Users that wish to search for a community directly can still do so as the search bar remains in the same position throughout. After selecting on a community, users can join the community, make posts on the forum, view trending content, and message other members of the community. Within the message tab, users can select who they want to message and how they want to message them. For examples, users have the option of using voice-chat, hand-writing, sending an image, or just typing regularly. 


## Prototype Testing 

The tester was sent a png file of the prototype, and we recorded our meeting on Zoom as he screenshared the prototype. As for tasks and interactions, the tester was asked to:

1.  Search for a community of interest
2.  Go through the interactive searching process
3.  Tap "Join" to join the community 
4.  Tap the profiles of people of interest from that community.
5.  Tap the "Chat" button to message that person
6.  Draw and send a hand-written message
7.  Send a voice recording message.
8.  Go back to the home page.

The link to the video of the prototype test can be found [here](https://youtu.be/rtldtxhx7wc).

**Notable interactions:**

* The user asked if there was a button to go back to a previous selection in the interactive search process. 

Other than this, the prototype test ran smoothly.

## Reflection/Changes to be made

Throughout this activity, my greatest area of trouble was drawing the wireflow because felt that arrows are self-explanatory and almost linear so the tester would therefore just follow that instead of exploring the other options. If I were to redo the interactive search process, I would not bold out certain options (e.g. Watch TV > Asian > K-Drama) and would likely forgo labeling the icons so that the tester is given less direct guidance. However, I can't think of a good way to describe the hierarchy without attaching labels. 

For the interactive filtering search process I forgot to provide an option to navigate between selection stages (e.g. go back from "What kind of shows?" to 
"What do you like to do?"). To remedy this, a swipe-feature/slider will be provided so that users do not have to click to get to the next selection--they can simply just swipe. The back button will instead but placed on the top side of the interface, which is more in-line with people's natural mental model when it comes to websites/apps.

The other features were relatively easy to follow and use.
