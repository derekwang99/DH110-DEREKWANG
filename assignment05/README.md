# Assignment 05: Low Fidelity Prototype

## Project Description

The premise of the project is to produce a product that is able to connect nearby senior citizens with each other to form communities of similar interests to improve their mental health through companionship. The user personas that were constructed were based on elderly people that are likely retired. This demographic is usually not tech savvy and have physical impairments or disabilities that make using technology difficult (e.g. myopia/hyperopia, arthritis, limited mobility). This demographic also tend to be lonelier and need greater emotional support as they often deal with a lot of problems (e.g. significant other/friends pass away, family is far away, health concerns, etc). This demographic maybe also address technology with skepticism or may even fear using technology. 

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test out our concepts and translate them into the basic framework of our product to see if the functionalities makes sense to older users. We can then adjust the prototype according the user feedback.

## Supported Task & Features

Based on user research, the features of the low-fidelity prototype will be able to do the following:
* Create an interactive (question-based) filtering search process to make finding a community simpler.
* The ability to join an existing community
* Contact another person and/or create a groupchat 

## Wireframes and Wireflow

Flow description: This flow intends for the user to search for a community based on their own personal interests. Users are asked a few questions to determine what community should be recommended to them. After selecting on a community, users can join the community, make posts on the forum, and message other members of the community. Within the message tab, users can select who they want to message and how they want to message them. Users have the option of using voice-chat, hand-writing, sending an image, or just typing regularly.
