# DH 150 Assignment 02: Usability Testing

# Pilot Usability Test

## Introduction 

1. One paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what you want to test especially based on the findings of heuristic evaluation. 

The Senior Assist Reminder and Learning app is a platform where users can create custom placards to perform nonverbal communication, Additionally, this app can create labels to adhere to physical objects so that the elderly can remember specific information throughout the day by just looking at the label. After conducting a heuristic evaluation on this app, several usability issues arose. To further investigate the issues of the app, we conducted a usability test.

A usability test is a way to gauge the user's thoughts and perception on the app's interface and ease of use. The usability tests are intended to improve the app by interpreting, analyzing, and implementing the user's feedback. 

Based on the heuristic evaluation from last week, the usability issues that were investigated involved the the homepage organization, the printing functionality, and the interpretability of the shortcuts for pre-filled labels. 

## Methodology

The usability test was conducted and recorded via Zoom on my personal computer. The session recorded the user's screen, which included the audio, the form as the user completes it, the user, and me.

## Reflection

The pilot usability test confirmed some of the weaknesses I have seen in Senior Assist Reminder and Learning, and taught me much about the usability test process.
The pilot test taught me to be cognizant of what I say and what I do. Behaving a certain way, even subconsciously, can alter the user's results during the interview. Thus it is important to be careful every step of the way. Overall, the interview went well! The user successfully completed most tasks and had a lot of feedback for the app. However, a few things could be improved. Firstly, I could have rehearsed the script better so that I would sound more natural. Secondly, towards the end, I was unsure whether to vocalize the instructions or not since they were rather self explanatory--the user was likely starting to grow impatient and beganto complete the page before I even prompted them to do so. Thirdly, there was a typo that caught me off guard and caused me to break my train of thought. 
Overall, the usability test was a relative success. The participant did enunciate some of his thinking process and pointed out some issues. The participant had little issue interpreting my tasks, which I particularly appreciate. To improve my usability tests in the future, the next time I will rehearse more, keep a consistent way of conducting the experiment, and double check the survey for grammatical errors or typos for the sake of professionalism.
